--INSTRUCTION--

read.py is the main python program to be used. This code will handle the car detection logic, handles yolov8l.pt engagement, handles OpenCV image preprocessing.

inside this code we have 2 important file variables called 
  - image_path (outter most indentation)
  - output_path (lies inside the class ImageProcessing -> detect_cars() function)

please update these variables according to your absolute directory, I have personally used this as my directory and will not most likely work for your program.

--About Code--
inside the detect_cars() function, theres a parameter called conf_threshold (confidence threshold). This is also an important parameter. It explains how sharp a car should be viewed, it ranges from 0-1
if threshold tends to being closer to 1, the harder it makes to detect vaguely looking car like objects because this explains the strictness of how a car is defined. For me I have capped at 0.25 a below average factor
This is because of different types of images I have uploaded inside the src/images folder. These photos will have a on road car image or off road car images, this being the reason why threshold is capped at below average threshold.
Personallization of code should end here. No other factors should be touched upon, they all play an important role in detecting and tracing what a car looks like.
